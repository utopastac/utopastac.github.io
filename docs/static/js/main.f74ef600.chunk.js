Having a usable, testable version of an idea helps me get to a better solution faster.  \n  &nbsp;  \nI write prototypes in many ways. At M&S, I used Google Polymer to create a design-driven, component led framework for creating [prototypes](https://medium.com/@utopastac/designing-a-style-guide-prototyping-toolkit-with-google-polymer-f898f73a2e0) for a system of apps (You can see the style guide itself [here](http://digistores-prototypes.mslabs.io/elements-guide/index.html#/home)).  \n&nbsp;  \nWhilst working at Google, I created many prototypes using React. The speed of iteration and the ability to use live data transformed our user testing approach. When working on the Wear OS team, I created the entire front end as a react app to allow for rapid testing on devices, with flexible controls to show the OS in different states, at different times, and with different user sttributes. This was also used as a style guide for early builds, showing all expected behaviours and edge cases.  \n&nbsp;  \nI tend to create all my prototypes in HTML and Javascript.
