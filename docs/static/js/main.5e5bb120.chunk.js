Having a usable, testable version of an idea helps me get to a better solution faster.  \n  &nbsp;  \nI write prototypes in many ways. At M&S, I used Google Polymer to create a design-driven, component led framework for creating [prototypes](https://medium.com/@utopastac/designing-a-style-guide-prototyping-toolkit-with-google-polymer-f898f73a2e0) for a system of apps (You can see the style guide itself [here](http://digistores-prototypes.mslabs.io/elements-guide/index.html#/home)).  \n&nbsp;  \nWhilst working at Google, I created many prototypes using React. The speed of iteration and the ability to use live data transformed our user testing approach. When working on the Wear OS team, I created the entire front end as a react app to allow for rapid testing on devices, with flexible controls to show the OS in different states, at different times, and with different user sttributes. This was also used as a style guide for early builds, showing all expected behaviours and edge cases.  \n&nbsp;  \nI tend to create all my prototypes in HTML and Javascript.

Having spent the evenings for a few months prior bootstrapping a discovery process, we dived in to build an MVP. After a year of research insight, we are currently committed to building the right product to launch in September.  \n&nbsp;  \nAt Circles, I have run a full, iterative UX process, including over 150 1-1 user interviews, creative workshops and many design and product iterations.  \n&nbsp;  \nI also managed the front-end development in our early days, releasing the app cross platform with feature parity using React Native.  \n          "},{type:"image",img:ca,alt:"Circles work example",caption:""},{type:"image",img:sa,alt:"Circles work example",caption:"The app is designed to be familiar and doesn't break from expectation in terms of a communication app."},{type:"image",img:aa,alt:"Circles work example",caption:"I worked closely with an illustrator and animator to set the tone for the brand."}]},{...Me,title:"The App",path:"#the-app",data:[{type:"copy",copy:"\n  ### The App\n  The app has been tested with several cohorts of users and has gone through several iterations.

Circles now offers short, online only, group-based practical learning programmes based around mental health. These courses are designed by experts and delivered by experienced peer mentors to small groups of 4-8 people. The courses are designed to be collaborative, giving a sense of purpose to the group in order to try and develop a connection that they can rely on in the future.\n          "},{type:"image",img:ia,alt:"Circles work example",caption:"The app is structured like a super-powered chat application.
