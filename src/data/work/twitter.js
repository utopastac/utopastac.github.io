  ### Twitter Blue Vision
  Within the Revenue Diversity org, I work leading design for the subscriptions team. We are focused on creating product market fit for a first of it's kind consumer subscription for Twitter power users. As part of this, I am leading long term vision work to set the strategy for the team for the upcoming year.
  &nbsp;  
  &nbsp;  
  This work is considered crucial in the company for growing sustainability in our revenue sources. I am working to drive excitement and alignment throughout the company, working closely with our design systems team to build a truly desirable product.

Peter's candour is one of my favourite things about him. You can always have an honest conversation with him. He is also one of the nicest guys I have met. Every-time I see him I come away happy! He is an incredible asset to any organisation.`,

As a design lead, his focus on the customer, learning and developing, openness to (wild) non-obvious ideas, and his intuitive problem-solving skills meant we were able to develop several demos successfully in just a couple days for our multi-layered blue sky product idea. Still can't grasp how that happened, though I know if it wasn't for Peter it wouldn't have.",

#### My role at Twitter is remote first, and requires a high degree of collaboration with teams across the company and the world. I work extremely closely with senior cross functional partners to build consensus around near future improvements and far off vision.
