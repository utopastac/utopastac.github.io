  ### Syzygy
  I started as a junior designer in [Syzygy](https://www.syzygy.de), working mainly with Mazda and Mercedes as clients. I worked on the digital campaigns for major car launches, and worked closely with excellent creative developers.  
&nbsp;  
I caught the programming bug, and started experimenting with creating games in Actionscript 3. I quickly progressed to a role as a creative technologist, where I was working on both design and development, in-between the creative teams and the technical teams.

  ### VML London
  When I joined [VML](https://www.vmlyr.com/en-gb/united-kingdom) (Good Technology), I was part of a small team as a 'Hypermedia designer'. The team's role was, essentially, to provide inspiration and advice to the technical and creative teams to make their ideas better.  
&nbsp;  
We sat directly between the two, creating prototypes, interaction designs, animations, and sometimes full products for clients like Audi and Microsoft.

#### I will always be greatful for my time working in client facing agencies. I learned how to code, learned how to storytell, and learned how to pitch an idea so it would land. We worked at an incredible pace in a very interesting time in UX maturity, and developed experiences that I am extremely proud of. I had the opportunity to manage and develop wonderful people who have all gone on to amazing things.
