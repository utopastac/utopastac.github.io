  ### Oversight
  Working on the Oversight Board, an international body of experts that has independent decision making power, I was responsible for defining strategy and improving the experience for Meta users and Board Staff. I focused on understanding and improving the value exchange between the different people involved in the process, as well as tactical and end-to-end experience design.

I set the vision of the team and drive practical outcomes, such as the Transparency hub, and oter experiences to involve external stakeolders in the rule making and safe guarding processes.
