      'Peter demonstrates leadership by listening, validating, and steering conversations in honest and productive ways. Peter\'s contributions go beyond tactical guidance; he fosters camaraderie and builds trust across the team. I deeply respect his leadership style, which prioritizes the growth and success of everyone around him. His humility is particularly admirable, especially for someone with his level of experience.',

    text:
      'Peter is perhaps the best non-manager mentor I have observed during my career. The speed at which he gained the ICs trust, improved their craft, and became a part of the team must be applauded and celebrated.',

    company: 'Cash App',
    text:
      'Peter is THE one designer everyone (in PD/CD/CI) is comfortable with, goes to for help, and is looked to in terms of craft and behavior. There are ICs who are natural leaders. He is ours.',

    company: 'Cash App',
    text:
      "One bit of Peter's Magic is that he's able to bring the team along to point out problems and make space to think about them together. He recognizes the root of the problem so quickly. Sometimes it feels like Peter's able to predict the future—because he says one thing and a few weeks or months later, the team realizes and own those perspectives together. Peter is almost always right, but he never forces the team to adopt his way of thinking—he brings everyone along and has a pulse on when the time is right/when teams are ready.",

    text:
      'What I enjoyed the most working with him, is how he tries to understand the design problems and look from a different perspective. Also, I was really impressed by his UI and Figma skills, with the whole file interconnected and extremely complete. It makes other designers\' and especially engineers\' lives easier.',
  },
  {
    company: 'Personio',
    text:
      'Continue being a source of inspiration for designers and really push some methodologies. I think the vision work would be the perfect playground to start fresh and get the time needed to create some great artefacts and resources. Overall I have found him to be a great sparring partner and I think he could really teach us a lot more from his experiences. It has always been easy to talk to him openly and that really helped alleviate some pains.',

    company: 'Personio',

      "When I saw Peter's designs, things were actually less scary and simpler. All concepts were pretty straight forward, and no Personio-invented/artificially added concepts were there.",

      "Peter has literally been a game changer when it comes to the quality of the design that we now have in Comp. He managed to unlock some projects that were previously blocked for weeks, in only a few days.",

    text:
      "The design explorations you're putting together: love how we're pushing the thinking to show what's possible but also trigger conversations to make decisions and narrow scope. Seeing your work made me so excited about the future of Performance.",

    text:
      'As a design lead, his focus on the customer, learning and developing, openness to (wild) non-obvious ideas, and his intuitive problem-solving skills meant we were able to develop several demos successfully in just a couple days for our multi-layered blue sky product idea.',

  {
    company: 'Spotify',
    text:
      "You are a highly experienced, strategic designer. You have more than met my expectations. You are able to zoom in and out of the small scale tweaks, and more importantly, you're able to lead our thinking about the broader user problems that we are trying to solve. This strategic thinking is something we have lacked previously in design partnership, but now that we have it, I honestly don't know what we would do without you.",

  {
    company: 'Spotify',
    text:
      "I have a thousand things to thank you for, but here are the three most important ones: Thank you for helping me grow by providing constant feedback, advice, and encouragement. Thank you for being so extremely open and transparent, and for involving the whole squad in design work; it makes a huge difference to feel our opinions matter in more than just technical discussions. Thank you for your silliness. It makes the dark, Swedish winter days a little brighter.",
